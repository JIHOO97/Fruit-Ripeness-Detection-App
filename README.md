## Introduction
With the increase in computational power and the improvement of machine learning models,
our team believes the method of determining fruit ripeness can be significantly simplified.
This means not having to think about large, expensive machines or carrying around
unnecessary weight. Our project aims to minimize the functionality of determining fruit
ripeness to our smartphones only.
